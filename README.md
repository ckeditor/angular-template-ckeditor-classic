# angular-template-ckeditor5-classic

CKEditor 5 Classic integrated with [Angular](https://angular.io/).

## Usage

To use this template as your starting point, you can use `degit`. It makes copies of git repositories.

For example:

```
npx degit ckeditor/angular-template-ckeditor-classic ckeditor5-classic-demo
```

When you run `degit` some-user/some-repo, it will find the latest commit on https://github.com/some-user/some-repo and download the associated tar file to ~/.degit/some-user/some-repo/commithash.tar.gz if it doesn't already exist locally.
